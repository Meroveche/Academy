1	PRE-INSTALLATION
1.1	IMPACT/DEPENDENCIES
The installation of this release will not impact other applications hosted within the ICE instances of ServiceNow.
While this is a Custom Scoped Application, there should be little technical risk with the installation due to notifications and general access being limited to users with reporting and/or system administrators rights.
The verification and validation of the system has been performed in the TEST instances. Further verification and validation will occur in the Production instances on the go-live date.
1.2	SOFTWARE INVENTORY
Installable application features are located in the ServiceNow Application Repository and a set Global Update Sets. The update sets are outlined below in 2.2
